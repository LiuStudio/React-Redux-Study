#React and Redux

## Something I have to get it out

This is a study notes I made in the process of learning react and redux. 
I have finished 3 react project and 1 redux, and now thinking of consolidate my knowledge for whom  with very little web development experience to wrap their head 
around easier. 

If any of these helps, then this repo served its purpose!

Code on and have fun!
